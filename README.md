# ENGR116_FINAL
This is a code that will calculate the best approach a hitter can have. This code accomplishes this goal by taking into account variables derived from pitcher profiles, hitter profiles and situation profiles. All in all in our formulas used 12 user inputed variables for our caculations.

To access this code you can input "miop.sytes.net" into your search bar. This is not currently not fully implemented but the website is up.

This whole code is found on a server we created using digitalOcean. This website is also hosted on our linux ubuntu server hosted on digitalOcean. 

The reason we did this is so that a user can access their information no matter where they are or what device they're on.

We are planning on continuing this project after this class is over because we are all on the baseball team and interested to see how much we can optimize this code.

In the submission you can find a copy of the files that are found on the server. To access these files you can either enter "ssh username@miop.sytes.net" in your terminal and the password "password" or run the "./login" file round in the repo. Option 2 is easier. After that all you need to do is access the game is enter "./logic" in the linux terminal once you are logged in. The username for the player once you have run the "./logic" is going to be either "Cooper" or "Robert" but feel free to create a new user as prompted by the server. Options for pitcher include "davidFinch" and "evanCarrier" but once again feel free to create your own pitchers.
